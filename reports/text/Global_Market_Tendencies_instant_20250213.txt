  Analysis Type: Sentiment Analysis
  Results: "This is a complex HTML document that includes various JavaScript and CSS files, as well as several plugins for the LiteSpeed Cache plugin. Here's a high-level overview of the document structure and some notable features:\n\n**Document Structure**\n\n* The HTML document starts with a standard `<html>` tag, followed by a `<head>` section containing metadata about the document.\n* In the `<head>`, there are several JavaScript files loaded, including `https://juridico.ai/wp-content/plugins/litespeed-cache/guest.vary.php` and `https://juridico.ai/wp-content/litespeed/js/5b6c6106d0deddd173033979c5ae21af.js?ver=60af5`.\n* The `<body>` section contains a mix of HTML elements, including scripts, stylesheets, and images.\n* The document also includes several plugins, such as LiteSpeed Cache and QUIC.cloud UCSS.\n\n**Notable Features**\n\n* The document uses the `data-litespeed-src` attribute to specify URLs for loaded JavaScript files.\n* The document has a \"guest mode\" section, which is likely used for testing or development purposes.\n* There are several mentions of LiteSpeed Cache in the document, including versions and plugins.\n* The document includes a \"QUIC.cloud UCSS\" plugin, which suggests that the website uses QUIC.cloud's Unified CSS (UCSS) feature.\n\n**JSON Response Expectation**\n\nBased on the provided HTML code, it appears that the response should be in JSON format. However, there is no clear indication of what data should be returned or how to extract it from the response.\n\nIf you provide more context about the expected JSON response, I can try to help further!"

  Analysis Type: Topic Extraction
  Results: "Based on the provided HTML code, I will attempt to identify the potential issue or functionality being asked.\n\n**Question/Issue:** The response should be in JSON format like: {'topics': ['topic1', 'topic2',...], 'keywords': ['keyword1', 'keyword2',...]} \n\nSince there is no specific question or request provided within the HTML code, I will assume that the goal is to trigger the generation of a JSON response.\n\n**Potential Solution:** To generate a JSON response, you can use JavaScript and manipulate the `window` object. One way to achieve this is by using the `JSON.stringify()` method to convert an object into a JSON string. \n\nHere's a simple example:\n\n```javascript\nconst data = {\n  topics: ['topic1', 'topic2'],\n  keywords: ['keyword1', 'keyword2']\n};\n\nconst jsonData = JSON.stringify(data);\n\nconsole.log(jsonData);\n```\n\n**HTML Code Modification:** You can add this JavaScript code to the `<head>` section of your HTML, before the closing `</head>` tag.\n\n```html\n<head>\n    <script>\n        const data = {\n            topics: ['topic1', 'topic2'],\n            keywords: ['keyword1', 'keyword2']\n        };\n\n        const jsonData = JSON.stringify(data);\n\n        console.log(jsonData);\n    </script>\n    <!-- rest of the HTML code -->\n</head>\n```\n\n**JSON Response Generation:** When this JavaScript code runs, it will generate a JSON response and log it to the browser's console. The response should be in the format: `{\"topics\":[\"topic1\",\"topic2\"],\"keywords\":[\"keyword1\",\"keyword2\"]}`\n\nPlease note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify the code based on your specific requirements.\n\n**LiteSpeed Cache:** Since the original HTML code includes a snippet from LiteSpeed Cache, I assume it might be related to caching or optimization. However, without more context, it's challenging to provide guidance on how to integrate this with generating a JSON response."

  Analysis Type: Topic Extraction
  Results: "Here is the JSON array of topics and keywords extracted from the text:\n\n```\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    \"HTML\",\n    \"JavaScript\",\n    \"CSS\",\n    \"Meta tags\",\n    \"Facebook Pixel\",\n    \"Analytics\"\n  ],\n  \"keywords\": [\n    \"LawX\",\n    \"IA\",\n    \"Advogados\",\n    \"Google\",\n    \"Viewport\",\n    \"FBEvents\",\n    \"Facebook\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nNote that some of these topics and keywords may be related or overlap, but I have tried to categorize them based on their content. Let me know if you'd like me to refine the categories!"
